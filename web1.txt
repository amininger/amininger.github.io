The internet has become an integral part of daily life and work,
and web sites are effective ways to communicate information, provide services, 
or grow businesses. 
In this course, we will learn about the fundamental languages and tools
involved in front-end web programming: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
These have separated roles of specifying the content, appearance, and behavior
of a web page. 
Students will learn how to design modern web pages, incorporating responsive
design practices and considerations for accessibility. 
A major part of the course will be building their own website and publishing it 
using Github pages. 
Topics covered include HTML elements, CSS selectors, cascading, box model, flexbox and grid layouts, JavaScript, DOM, and web forms.
